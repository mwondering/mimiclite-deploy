# sim2real

A lightweight and modular sim2sim and sim2real deployment stack.

Chinese version: [README_zh.md](./README_zh.md)

Full documentation: [https://egalahad.github.io/sim2real/](https://egalahad.github.io/sim2real/)

If you're looking for the HDMI deployment stack, go to [hdmi tag](https://github.com/EGalahad/sim2real/tree/hdmi).

## Runtime Artifacts

The SP-Tracking 0728 / 22000 and SPV5-2A / 105000 deploy artifacts are included
in this repository. Other large runtime artifacts are not stored in git. Download the shared
[sim2real artifacts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lrPyiiy7anyG3P4wHNIQQQlydboLPd9e)
folder and place `checkpoints/` and `third_party/` at the repo root.

See [Download Artifacts](./docs/artifacts.md) for the expected directory
layout and onboard dependency notes.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv sync --extra inference-cpu
```

For G1 onboard installation or repair, invoke the repository Codex skill
`$configure-g1-sim2real` from `.agents/skills/configure-g1-sim2real`.

Run offline motion tracking (sim2sim):

```bash
uv run sim2real/sim_env/base_sim.py --robot g1
uv run sim2real/rl_policy/tracking.py --robot g1 \
  --policy_config checkpoints/mimic-lite/v1_1/policy.yaml \
  --motion_path hf://elijahgalahad/any4hdmi-g1-lafan/motions/walk1_subject1.npz
```

After both processes are up, press `]` in the policy terminal to start. Open the mjviser URL printed by `base_sim.py`, then use the Elastic Band controls in the viewer UI to disable or tune the virtual gantry.

## Migrating to sim2real

This repo includes a Codex skill for adapting policies trained in external codebases into `sim2real`:

```text
.agents/skills/adapt-policy-to-sim2real
```

Converted checkpoints are distributed through the shared
[sim2real artifacts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lrPyiiy7anyG3P4wHNIQQQlydboLPd9e)
folder.

Currently supported adapted / distributed checkpoint families:

| Policy family | Config path(s) | Notes |

| HoloMotion v1.4.0 | `checkpoints/holomotion/v1_4_0/policy.yaml` | Uses the official unmodified ONNX from [HorizonRobotics/HoloMotion_models](https://huggingface.co/HorizonRobotics/HoloMotion_models/resolve/main/HoloMotion_motion_tracking_model_v1.4.0/exported/model_14000.onnx); place it at `checkpoints/holomotion/v1_4_0/policy.onnx`. |
| TeleopIT | `checkpoints/teleopit/policy.yaml` | TeleopIT policy wrapper. |
| Humanoid-GPT | `checkpoints/humanoid-gpt/policy.yaml` | Humanoid-GPT policy wrapper. |
| HEFT | `checkpoints/heft` | PMG and compliance variants. |
| TWIST2 | `checkpoints/twist2/policy.yaml` | TWIST2 policy wrapper. |
| SP-Tracking SPV5-2 (0728 / 22000) | `checkpoints/sp-tracking/0728_baoshou_waist_dataclean_changedr/policy.yaml` | Includes the deploy ONNX; [sim2sim and G1 commands](docs/tutorials/sp-tracking-0728.md). |
| SP-Tracking SPV5-2A (0907 / 105000) | `checkpoints/sp-tracking/spv5_2a_0907_105000/policy.yaml` | Includes the deploy ONNX; [sim2sim and G1 commands](checkpoints/sp-tracking/spv5_2a_0907_105000/README.md). |

![Unified cross-codebase tracking evaluation](assets/mimic_lite_cross_codebase_tracking_eval.png)

For a fair comparison, we report the motion-lookahead latency required by each
policy, defined by its furthest required future-reference frame. All values use
the shared 50 Hz reference-motion contract.

| Policy | Mimic-Lite v1.1 | Mimic-Lite Huge | Mimic-Lite Base | Mimic-Lite Huge ROA | Mimic-Lite Small | ScaleBFM M | ScaleBFM XL | SONIC | SONIC low-latency | SONIC v1.1 | HoloMotion | HEFT | TeleopIT | Humanoid-GPT | BFM-Zero | TWIST2 | SPV5-2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Motion-lookahead latency | 0.08 s | 0.08 s | 0.08 s | 0.08 s | 0.08 s | 0.10 s | 0.10 s | 0.90 s | 0.18 s | 0.90 s | 0.20 s | 0.12 s | 0.00 s | 0.02 s | 0.12 s | 0.00 s | 0.14 s |

## Real-robot Environments

Robot SDKs are kept out of the generic root environment. G1 inline deployment
uses `uv sync --extra inference-cpu --extra robot-g1`. See
[Robot I/O Modes](./docs/robot_io.md) for setup and deployment commands.
